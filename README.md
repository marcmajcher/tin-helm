# Tin Helm

You are an adventurer trapped in the stronghold of the Red Cloth. These once peaceful clerics have been corrupted by vile magic. You must locate all three Shards of Brahm to release the clerics of their spell and to find your way out of the dungeon. If you cannot do so by the end of the fifth level of the dungeon, you also become corrupted and lose the game.

## Components

* 12 Dungeon Cards
* 8 Enemy Cards
* 8 Loot Cards
* 4 Trapping Cards
* 4 Race/Class Cards
* 4 Tracker Cards
* 3 Reference Cards
* 3 Purple Shards of Brahm
* 5 Tracking Cubes
* 2 Dice
* 1 Meeple

## Setup 

Make a 2x2 grid with the tracker cards (Dungeon Level/Monster HP, Favor, Health, Energy/Food). 

* Health: 0-14
* Energy: 1-13
* Food: 1-5
* Favor: 0-15
* Dungeon level: 1-5
* Enemy HP: 1-12

Choose one Race card and one Class card. (Some races/classes are on the same card, preventing some combinations—human/alchemist, gnome/marauder, kroling/foodpad, merfolk/parson.)

* Human: ❤️9 ⚡️7 🍖0
  Humans may select 1 extra Trappings Card from the remaining cards before beginning their adventure.
* Gnome: ❤️6 ⚡️9 🍖1
  Gnomes perform both actions at the campsite instead of picking one.
* Kroling: ❤️8 ⚡️8 🍖0
  Once per dungeon level, while in combat, the Kroling may flip a single die to the reverse side when determining damage.
* Merfolk: ❤️7 ⚡️8 🍖1
  Whenever Merfolk resolve a location with a water icon, they may either gain 1 Health or 1 Energy.

* Alchemist: ❤️3 ⚡️4 ⭐️2 ⭐️⭐️4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️6
  Books and Potion
* Marauder: ❤️5 ⚡️2 ⭐️1 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️8
  Axe and Bedroll
* Footpad: ❤️3 ⚡️3 ⭐️2 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️7
  Dagger and Toolkit
* Parson: ❤️4 ⚡️3 ⭐️3 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️7
  Mace and Scroll

Determine your starting Health and Energy by combining the ❤️ and ⚡️ values on the Class and Race cards, and set up the Health and Energy trackers. During play, your health and energy may never exceed these starting values. Take a moment to read your special ability and trappings effects.

Check to see if your adventurer starts with any 🍖food and set the appropriate value (1 or 0) on the food tracker. You may never have more than 5 food. On the bottom of your class card you will find your starting Trappings. Locate these cards and place them next to your adventurer race/class cards. 

Lastly, get your two dice ready, and place the reference cards, enemy deck, and loot deck dearby. Shuffle the duneon cards and place them with the map sides facing up.

## Exploration

Tin Helm is played in rounds called "levels", and each level is made up of six turns called "rooms". The end of the level is reached after you resolve the sixth and final room of that level.

### Turn Sequence

Look at the top card of the dungeon deck and decide if you want to resolve this room, or skip it. Note the icons on the card, as they will give you an idea of what's in the room.

Resolve: Put the top card to the side of the deck, and flip over the next card to the results side. This creates the room. Resolve the icons corresponding to the room in order, according to the results card.

Skip: The same procedure, but the top card is flipped and used for the results table, and the next card is used as is, looking up the icons and resolving them in order.

Each room requires two cards—there are twelve cards in the deck, so each level will contain six rooms. 

The six different types of icons in the rooms are:

* Enemy: Find the enemy card for the specified enemy you're fighting, and engage in combat.
* Trap: Check the result card to determine how much damage (health or energy) you take.
* Random: Resolve the enemy, trap, or loot as shown, or refer to the reference cards for details on the Altar, Campsite, Grove, Labyrinth,Pigman, and Shrine.
* Loot: Refer to the loot card for the displayed result and place it by your character. If you find a Mimic, engage it in combat.
Campsite: You may either rest (gaining 2 health and 1 energy) or forage for food (gaining 1 food).
Water: You can always fish for food in water. Roll 1 die—if the result is a 5 or 6, you gain 1 food.

## Combat

When you enter combat, locate the enemy card for the enemy you're fighting. Take note of their special power.

**Health**: To determine the enemy's health, add the ❤️ value on the enemy card to the current dungeon level. Use the enemy HP tracker to keep track of the enemy's health.

**Attack**: The value next to the dagger icon is the extra damage this enemy will inflict if they successfully hit.

**Defense**: Subtract the number next to the shield icon from your attacks.

**Favor**: If you defeat the enemy, gain favor equal to the value next to the ankh icon.

If an enemy has a skull icon in the bottom right corner, that enemy is undead. (The Skelepede, Doom Skull, and Wraith.)

In combat, you always get to attack first, unless an enemy's special power says otherwise. Before you roll for an attack, decide how much energy you wish to expend on your attack. Each class has one, two, and three bolts with numbers—the more energy you spend, the more damage you do. If you have zero energy (or if you choose), you may simply deal 1 damage that your foe cannot defend against.

Once you have spent the energy to attack, roll both dice. Subtract the lower die from the higher one to determine your raw attack value—add your energy bonus to determine your total damage. Doubles always miss and deal zero damage, regardless of the energy bonus. 

If the enemy has any defense, subtract that from your damage, then subtract the remaining damage from the enemy's health track. If the enemy's health is reduced to zero, you win the combat and gain favor as indicated on their card. If you fail to defeat them, they get to attack you! 

Enemies attack by rolling the dice, as well. Doubles are still a miss—otherwise, subtract the lower die from the higher one and add the enemy's attack bonus. If you have a shield, you may subtract 1 damage from the enemy's attack. Reduce your health by the amount of damage dealth—if you are alive, you may attack again. If you have reached zero health, you are dead and the game ends. Combat continues back and forth until one of you dies.

## Ending a Level

When you have worked your way through all six rooms, you descend to the next dungeon level. Follow these steps:

1. Move the level tracker one level down. If you complete the fifth level, you lose.
2. Feed your hero by consuming 1 food. If you have no food, suffer 3 damage to your health from hunger.
3. Shuffle the dungeon deck to create a new pile of cards, room side up, to form the next level of the dungeon. Explore away!

### Food and Shards

You can locate shards in the following ways:

1. By defeating a possessor.
2. By finding a shrine.
3. By trading a turnip to the Pigman.
4. By having enough favor when you locate an altar.
5. By finding one as Loot.

## Ending the Game

As soon as you gain your third Shard, the game ends, and the curse is lifted. You are victorious!

If at any point you run out of health or complete the 5th level of the dungeon, you lose.

### Scoring

* 10 Points for each Shard
* Points equal to the sum of your health, energy, and food.
* 2 points for each Favor.
* Subtract double the value of your ending dungeon level.
