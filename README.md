# Tin Helm

You are an adventurer trapped in the stronghold of the Red Cloth. These once peaceful clerics have been corrupted by vile magic. You must locate all three Shards of Brahm to release the clerics of their spell and to find your way out of the dungeon. If you cannot do so by the end of the fifth level of the dungeon, you also become corrupted and lose the game.

## Components

* 12 Dungeon Cards
* 8 Enemy Cards
* 8 Loot Cards
* 4 Trapping Cards
* 4 Race/Class Cards
* 4 Tracker Cards
* 3 Reference Cards
* 3 Purple Shards of Brahm
* 5 Tracking Cubes
* 2 Dice
* 1 Meeple

## Setup 

Make a 2x2 grid with the tracker cards (Dungeon Level/Monster HP, Favor, Health, Energy/Food). 

* Health: 0-14
* Energy: 1-13
* Food: 1-5
* Favor: 0-15
* Dungeon level: 1-5
* Enemy HP: 1-12

Choose one Race card and one Class card. (Some races/classes are on the same card, preventing some combinations—human/alchemist, gnome/marauder, kroling/foodpad, merfolk/parson.)

* Human: ❤️9 ⚡️7 🍖0
  Humans may select 1 extra Trappings Card from the remaining cards before beginning their adventure.
* Gnome: ❤️6 ⚡️9 🍖1
  Gnomes perform both actions at the campsite instead of picking one.
* Kroling: ❤️8 ⚡️8 🍖0
  Once per dungeon level, while in combat, the Kroling may flip a single die to the reverse side when determining damage.
* Merfolk: ❤️7 ⚡️8 🍖1
  Whenever Merfolk resolve a location with a water icon, they may either gain 1 Health or 1 Energy.

* Alchemist: ❤️3 ⚡️4 ⭐️2 ⭐️⭐️4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️6
  Books and Potion
* Marauder: ❤️5 ⚡️2 ⭐️1 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️8
  Axe and Bedroll
* Footpad: ❤️3 ⚡️3 ⭐️2 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️7
  Dagger and Toolkit
* Parson: ❤️4 ⚡️3 ⭐️3 ⭐️⭐️5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️7
  Mace and Scroll

Determine your starting Health and Energy by combining the ❤️ and ⚡️ values on the Class and Race cards, and set up the Health and Energy trackers. During play, your health and energy may never exceed these starting values. Take a moment to read your special ability and trappings effects.

Check to see if your adventurer starts with any 🍖food and set the appropriate value (1 or 0) on the food tracker. You may never have more than 5 food. On the bottom of your class card you will find your starting Trappings. Locate these cards and place them next to your adventurer race/class cards. 

Lastly, get your two dice ready, and place the reference cards, enemy deck, and loot deck dearby. Shuffle the duneon cards and place them with the map sides facing up.

## Exploration

Tin Helm is played in rounds called "levels", and each level is made up of six turns called "rooms". The end of the level is reached after you resolve the sixth and final room of that level.
