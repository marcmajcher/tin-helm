# Tin Helm

You are an adventurer trapped in the stronghold of the Red Cloth. These once peaceful clerics have been corrupted by vile magic. You must locate all three Shards of Brahm to release the clerics of their spell and to find your way out of the dungeon. If you cannot do so by the end of the fifth level of the dungeon, you also become corrupted and lose the game.
